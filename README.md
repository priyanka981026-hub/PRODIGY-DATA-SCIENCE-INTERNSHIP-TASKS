# PRODIGY-DATA-SCIENCE-INTERNSHIP-TASK
Prodigy Internship Tasks

This repository contains the tasks I completed as part of my Prodigy Internship. Each task demonstrates hands-on implementation of Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning concepts using real-world datasets.

Task 1 â€“ Data Visualization with Matplotlib (World Population Dataset)

Loaded a world population dataset from GitHub.

Created a bar chart to compare total male vs female population.

Plotted a histogram to visualize the distribution of population across numeric columns.

Used Matplotlib for clear and customizable visualizations


Task 2 â€“ Titanic Survival Analysis (Seaborn)

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Seaborn.

Handled missing values using median (Age) and mode (Embarked) imputation.

Created a count plot to show survival distribution.

Built a stacked histogram to compare age distribution between survivors and non-survivors.

Visualized relationships with a correlation heatmap, highlighting features affecting survival.

Task 3 â€“ Decision Tree Classifier (Bank Marketing Dataset)

Developed a Decision Tree model on the Bank Marketing dataset. Encoded categorical variables, split into train/test sets, trained a DecisionTreeClassifier, and visualized the tree structure. Evaluated model accuracy to understand classification and ML workflows.
