Task 1 â€“ Titanic Dataset EDA
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. Cleaned missing values, visualized survival distribution, age vs survival trends, and correlation heatmaps.

Task 2 â€“ Decision Tree Classifier (Bank Dataset)
Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier on a banking dataset to predict whether a client subscribes to a term deposit. Encoded categorical features, trained the model, and visualized the decision.

Task 3 â€“ Decision Tree Classifier (Bank Marketing Dataset)

Developed a Decision Tree model on the Bank Marketing dataset. Encoded categorical variables, split into train/test sets, trained a DecisionTreeClassifier, and visualized the tree structure. Evaluated model accuracy to understand classification and ML workflows.
